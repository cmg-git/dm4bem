- t02: Model and dynamc simulation of a simple wall with capacities in all nodes.
- t03: Model and dynamic simulation of a cubic building with proportional feed-back control.
- t04: Assembling thermal circuits.
- t05: Heating and cooling with dead-band.
- t06: Control by changing the inputs during the itegration in time.
- t07: Free-cooling by switching between models and changing the inputs during the integration.
